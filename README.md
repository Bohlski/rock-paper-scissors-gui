# Rock, Paper, Scissors v2
An ordinary Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in JS.
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation).  
Continuation of the ['Rock Paper Scissors' project](
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav), now instead with an actual interface.
